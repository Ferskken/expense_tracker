 Expense_tracker school assignment




My additional feautures are:

Added formating to amount text field to keep user from being able to type anything but the numbers 0-9.

I split the general error message in the popup you get when trying to save an invalid new expense by making a list of strings called errorMessages, adding the messages with if statements and then showing the list error dialog by giving the listerrorMessages as a parameter to the _showErrorDialog and joining the strings with a new line \n between each.

Added a button in new_expense to set the date to current date.
